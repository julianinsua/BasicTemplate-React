# Basic Template - React
This is my basic template for a Rect APP. Some general information:
* It uses CRA as a basic mainframe
* The code is writen using typescript
* State management is done with MobX
* Routing using React-Router-Dom v6
* Linting using ESLint
* Formated using Prettier

## 1. Components
Inside you will find a couple of components and a couple of pages. All pages are just a rough sketch in order to set up the conditions for a "ready to start" approach.
Some of the Components and Stores you will find:

* Router
* Private Routes
* Gated Routes, Components and Links
* AuthUser Model and required Interfaces.
* Containers for nav bar header and content
* Button
* Date picker
* Select
* Table
* Form Label
* Image Input
* Input
* Generic input wrapper
* Layout component
* Literal value component
* Loading Circle and Loading Ring
* Pagination Component
* Text Area

## 2. Possible next steps
I might switch the bundler to vite since it's faster and has a lot of out of the box support
I might add support for a store and a service to connect to a websocket.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
